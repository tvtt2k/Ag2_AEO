# AEO Validator

AEO Validator is an automated multi-agent pipeline designed to **validate search engine visibility** for a given companyâ€™s website.  
It leverages [AG2.ai's framework](https://ag2.ai/#hero) to coordinate multiple conversational agents that perform:

1. **Homepage Summarization (Tech Agent)**  
   - Opens the target website and generates a YAML summary.  

2. **Prompt Generation (Prompt Agent)**  
   - Reads the summary and produces **5 optimized search queries**.  

3. **Search Validation (Validation Agent)**  
   - Executes the queries on Google/Bing.  
   - Checks whether the companyâ€™s domain appears in the first-page results.  
   - Records results (Y/N + notes).  

The agents are orchestrated using a **round-robin pattern** to enforce sequential handoffs until the task is complete.
